## Install Roboto Condensed

### Option 1: Google Fonts (Recommended)

1. Visit: [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed)
2. Click "Get font" â†’ "Download all"
3. Unzip the downloaded file
4. Open each `.ttf` file and click "Install Font"

### Option 2: System Fonts

If you have **Adobe Creative Cloud** or **Microsoft Office**, Roboto Condensed may already be installed!

### Option 3: Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install font-roboto-condensed
```

---

## Verify Installation

Open **Font Book** (macOS built-in app):
1. Press `âŒ˜ + Space` â†’ Type "Font Book"
2. Search for "Roboto Condensed"
3. You should see: Roboto Condensed Light, Regular, Bold, etc.

## Fallback

If Roboto Condensed isn't installed, the app will fallback to:
- **macOS System Font** (San Francisco)
- **Sans-serif default**

The app will still work perfectly, just with a different font!
