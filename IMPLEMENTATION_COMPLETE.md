## üéä The Final Feature: Temporal Tracking

### What It Does
Ask your file organizer: **"What files did I download yesterday?"**

And it knows! üéâ

### How It Works
1. **Event Logging:** Every file interaction is logged with timestamp
2. **Natural Language:** Parses "yesterday", "last week", "3 days ago"
3. **Smart Queries:** Understands downloads vs modifications vs access
4. **Chat Integration:** Conversational AI detects temporal intents
5. **CLI Shortcuts:** `!yesterday` = instant temporal query

### Examples

**In Chat:**
```
You: What files did I download yesterday?

AI: I found 1 file from yesterday:

1. V2.Parents-Kids-and-Money.pptx
   üìÅ /Users/bre/Downloads/Presentations
   üïê 2025-10-24 04:51
   PowerPoint presentation about financial literacy...
```

**In CLI:**
```bash
$ ./o !yesterday

‚è∞ Searching for files from 'yesterday'...

‚ú® Found 1 files from the last 1 days:

   1. V2.Parents-Kids-and-Money.pptx
      üìÅ /Users/bre/Downloads/Presentations
      üïê 2025-10-24 04:51
```

**Supported Queries:**
- "yesterday", "today", "this morning"
- "last week", "this week", "last month"
- "3 days ago", "2 hours ago"
- "last 7 days", "past 2 weeks"
