./o @Downloads            # Clean Downloads

# Search files
./o ?invoice              # Find invoices
./o ?important            # Find important files

# Time-based queries (NEW!)
./o !yesterday            # Yesterday's files
./o !today                # Today's files
./o WHEN@'last week'      # Last week's files

# Advanced
./o TAG@Documents         # AI tag files
./o GRAPH@ProjectX        # Show project
